## About this project

In a few words, this project is a simple visualization inspired by InsideAirbnb, written in R, built on Shiny framework.

This projects aims at analyzing publicly available information about a city's Airbnb's listings. In doing so, it provides filters and key metrics so you can see how Airbnb listings compare all around the globe.

## Behind this project

The tools are presented simply, and can also be used to answer more complicated questions, such as:

- Which city is the most expensive?
- How does the bedroom distribution in Sevilla compare to the one in Bordeaux?
- What's the average price of all listings in Florence compared to Mallorca?

## Features

Features include:

- Selection of multiple cities for in depth analysis
- Comparison based on multiple features (e.g., price, beds, etc.)
- Selection of minimum and maximum dates for all listings
- Various plot types
- Visualization of listings on a map
